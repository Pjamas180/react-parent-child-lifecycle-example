React Module which will let us view the order that certain built-in React functions will run.

To run, make sure you have npm installed. 

Download the repository into a directory, then run "npm install" to get the correct dependencies. Dependencies may change over time.

In the command line, execute "npm start" to start the webpack-dev-server which will allow us to compile and run the files in a local server.

In a web browser, open localhost:8080, then open up the corresponding dev tools. View the Console (Google Chrome) to see how the functions are executed!

Code was taken from fay-jai on Github then implemented into a React web-dev-server for easier load and run.
